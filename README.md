- Abstract: The development of a continental-scale water temperature model is a leading priority in the field ofwater quality prediction, given the recognized links between river thermal regimes and viability ofecosystems, in-stream habitats, and fisheries. We developed a physics-based heat budget model to predict water temperatures using operational outputs from the National Water Model (NWM)Version 2.1, including meteorological forcings, streamflow, groundwater inflow, and channel geometry. Using several configurations of our model, including both Eulerian and reverse particle tracking semi-Lagrangian computational schemes, we explored the feasibility of incorporating sub-hourly water temperature prediction and forecasting into the framework of the NWM. Initial modelresults within a test basin suggest that heat budget approaches to water temperature modeling forced by NWM outputs can produce predictions with acceptable error to observed temperatures during summer baseflow periods. We found that the semi-Lagrangian scheme was better suited to generating water temperature predictions at the NWMâ€™s desired spatial resolution and temporal frequency, as it produced convergent results with computational effort suitable to upscaling to larger spatial domains. Model performance in high-order mainstem channels exceeded that of first-order streams, likely due to the increased influence of groundwater inflow uncertainty along headwater reaches. Future model development will include application to additional test basins, the incorporation of reservoir heat and winter ice dynamics, and sensitivity analyses.
