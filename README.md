## AGU 2022 - Incorporating Physics-Based Water Temperature Predictions Into the National Water Model Framework ##
- Abstract: The development of a continental-scale water temperature model is a leading priority in the field ofwater quality prediction, given the recognized links between river thermal regimes and viability ofecosystems, in-stream habitats, and fisheries. We developed a physics-based heat budget model to predict water temperatures using operational outputs from the National Water Model (NWM)Version 2.1, including meteorological forcings, streamflow, groundwater inflow, and channel geometry. Using several configurations of our model, including both Eulerian and reverse particle tracking semi-Lagrangian computational schemes, we explored the feasibility of incorporating sub-hourly water temperature prediction and forecasting into the framework of the NWM. Initial modelresults within a test basin suggest that heat budget approaches to water temperature modeling forced by NWM outputs can produce predictions with acceptable error to observed temperatures during summer baseflow periods. We found that the semi-Lagrangian scheme was better suited to generating water temperature predictions at the NWMâ€™s desired spatial resolution and temporal frequency, as it produced convergent results with computational effort suitable to upscaling to larger spatial domains. Model performance in high-order mainstem channels exceeded that of first-order streams, likely due to the increased influence of groundwater inflow uncertainty along headwater reaches. Future model development will include application to additional test basins, the incorporation of reservoir heat and winter ice dynamics, and sensitivity analyses.

## AGU 2021 - Exploring continental-scale relationships between stream temperature signatures and watershed characteristics ##
- Abstract: Water temperature is vitally important for the health of rivers and streams, influencing the quality and integrity of habitats and, in turn, ecosystems and the services they provide. While climate has been regarded traditionally as the primary organizing driver of stream temperature regimes, other factors such as hydrology, watershed structure, and human impacts modify water temperature signatures. To better understand how and why stream temperatures vary both spatially and temporally, we sought to disentangle the underlying drivers of thermal signatures, including maximum temperature, monthly range, and thermal sensitivity, using a random forest machine learning approach. Random forest is an analytical technique that leverages an ensemble of classification and regression trees to model target values using a group of predictor variables. We applied a set of random forest models to identify the primary drivers of various stream temperature signatures at 412 sites spanning the conterminous United States. For our analysis, we selected 26 relevant predictor variables from the GAGES-II database of watershed characteristics (Falcone, 2011) and grouped these variables into four key categories: climate, human impacts in terms of dams and land use, hydrology, and watershed structure. The results of our random forest models revealed seasonal and spatial variability in the relative importance of watershed predictor variables to stream temperature signatures. At continental scales, the presence of dams had a strong organizing influence on thermal signatures such as maximum water temperature and thermal sensitivity, though the importance of dams differed between streams in the eastern and western US. Beyond climate, characteristics related to local hydrology (including streamflow and groundwater contributions) were particularly important predictors across all stream temperature signatures, emphasizing that hydrology may mediate the role of climate in organizing thermal regimes. Our work demonstrates that continental US water temperatures are not solely organized by climate response and are influenced by hydrological processes and landscape modification by humans.
